People often say to me, why do you go with her
She's not the sort of girl we thought you'd choose
Well frankly I just don't know why myself I must admit
That she's the girl you wouldn't like to lose

And I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
I couldn't fall in love with anybody else

Look into her face and you will see she's rather plain
I think that's unanimously agreed
Her hair is wrong her nose is long but even though they are
She means all the world to me

And I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
I couldn't fall in love with anybody else

She isn't everything a girl should be
But find me one that is
She isn't everything a girl should be
But find me one that is

People often say to me, why do you go with her
She's not the sort of girl we thought you'd choose
Well frankly I just don't know why myself I must admit
That she's the girl you wouldn't like to lose

And I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
